# Face-Detection Program Using Python

## Face-Detection: 
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.

## How Does It Works ?
- A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match.
- Facial recognition software reads the geometry of your face. Key factors include the distance between your eyes and the distance from forehead to chin.
- The software identifies facial landmarks — one system identifies 68 of them — that are key to distinguishing your face.
- The result: your facial signature.

## How To Use The Program:
1. Clone The Repo To Desired Location
```
git clone https://github.com/The-Nightwing/Face_Detection.git
```
2. You Will See That Repo Contains Two Files:
  - face_detection_train.py
  - face_detection_test.py
3. First We Need To Train The Program So we Run "face_detection_train.py":
```
python face_detection_train.py
```
4. This Will Feed All The Data To The ML Model In Order To Make It Work Correctly. This Will Feed The Data Through File faces.npy
5. Then We Can Use "face_detection_test.py" To See If It Works Correctly Or Not.
